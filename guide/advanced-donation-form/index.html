<h2 id="setup">Advanced Donation Form</h2>

<p>The Advanced Donation Form Part and accompanying REST APIs were released in version 3.0 of BBIS.  They allow completely custom interfaces to be created for the donation experience, relaying the necessary information to the backend via the REST API or JavaScript SDK.  For a complete list of possible options, be sure to visit the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reference/rest/#donationapi">technical reference</a> for more information.</p>

<p>All the examples below expect a page with a configured instance of the Advanced Donation Form Part on it.  It's also important the examples below are meant to be as simple and straight-forward as possible.  In a real-world scenario, we highly suggestion following standard web practices for form design, including labels for accessibility, and client-side data validation.</p>

<p>For all the Advanced Donation Form examples, I've split the grouped the content by language - HTML, CSS, or JS; however, when using the code in the Advanced Donation Form Part, the code is combined into a single textarea.  Please be certain to wrap the content with appropriate <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.</p>
