##Contributing##

Third-party contributions are how we keep the code samples great. Blackbaud simply can't create every conceivable code sample. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that show others how to do cool things with the Blackbaud CRM SDK and API. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

For more information, see our [canonical contributing guide](https://github.com/bbBobbyEarl/Blackbaud-CRM/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Blackbaud Community repo which provides detailed instructions, including those requiring a valid signature of the [Contributor License Agreement](http://developer.blackbaud.com/cla).
